    "## Introduction\n",
    "***\n",
    "Complex terrain in mountainous areas often make predicting snowfall difficult with prognostic weather models - especially on specific slopes or mountainsides. Extremely localized air flows often complicate traditional approaches to forecasting with prognostic models.  With more accurate snow forecasts, ski resorts can optimize their snowfall making, grooming, and snow removal operations. An accurate short term snowfall forecast, even for a small segment of a mountain may assist a ski resort's operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study is to get a glimpse into the potential of utilizing supervised learning techniques with freely available surface  meteorological data to predict snowfall on a slope at Copper Mountain Ski Resort in Colorado.  Copper Mountain Ski Resort is an optimal place to perform this analysis as meteorological stations near and on the resort have been recording meteorological conditions for over ten years, resulting in a dataset which includes meteorological conditions during a large sampling of snowstorms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report discusses data to be utilized and describes initial analyses used to make a general assessment regarding how well a supervised learning model might perform. The following subsections discuss the datasets utilized, data wrangling and cleaning, performed, a linear regression analysis, as well as overall conclusions and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The Copper Mountain ski resort is unique as there is an official SNOTEL National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) monitoring station located on the north slope of Copper Mountain, where many popular ski runs are located. SNOTEL stations are part of a telemetry automated system of snowpack and related climate sensors in the western United States. In addition to reporting hourly snowfall amounts, this SNOTEL station also records temperature.  The Copper Mountain ski area also has a Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) which monitors a suite of hourly variables near the top of Copper Mountain.  Additionally, a National Weather Service Automated Surface Observing Station (ASOS) is located in Leadville, CO approximately 30 km to the northwest of Copper Mountain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These three stations give a comprehensive meteorological dataset of surface variables in the vicinity of the Copper Mountain Resort.   **Table 1** gives a listing of all surface level meteorological variables by station. Hourly data for each station was downloaded for years 2005-2017 from online sources.  Data sources for each station are found in **Table 2**.  A map showing the locations of the Copper Mountain SNOTEL site and the meteorological sites used in this assessment is also shown in **Figure 1**.  \n",

    "## Data and Wrangling Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Organization\n",
    "Hourly surface data from each station in **Table 1** were downloaded, organized and combined into a single timeseries dataframes with UTM timestamps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following cleanup steps were performed on the datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    " - While the KCCU and KXLV datasets were already in UTM time, the SNOTEL dataset was in Mountain time and required conversion to UTM.   \n",
    " - The KCCU and KXLV datasets are in the Integrated Surface Hourly Data (ISHD) format and did require some manipulation (e.g. divided by 10) to get values into typical units. \n",
    " - Missing values (e.g. 9999 values) were translated to NaN values.\n",
    " - Missing data for all variables was linearly interpolated for time periods where 3 hours or less of data was missing.  \n",
    " - Because only 00:00 and 12:00 snowfall observations were utilized in the analysis, all variables in the meteorological dataframe were reduced from hourly observations to twelve hour observations.  A new dataframe was created utilizing only 00:00 and 12:00 observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was plotted to see if there were any extreme values warranting removal. It was noted that some of the KCCU data (especially temperature) did not demonstrate as much of a diurnal variation as the KXLV station.  These data are considered suspicious but were not removed from the dataset.  A more robust quality control of this dataset is outside the scope of this preliminary study, but should be considered for future studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small amount of anomalous data was also observed in the SNOTEL snow depth data and was removed.  These physically unrealistic readings (e.g. spikes in some of the snow depth data or snowdepth reports which occur when temperatures did not support snowfall) were removed as well as extreme negative values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional calculated columns were added to the timeseries dataframe.  These included 12-hour Pressure Changes, as well as 12-hour Snowfall Totals.  These additional calculated features are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12-hour Pressure Change**  \n",
    "Barometric pressure changes are often a predictive indicator of future weather conditions. Pressure drops often are predictors of approaching strong storm systems, and rising pressure is also a good indicator of upcoming fair weather conditions.  For this reason, a twelve hour pressure change feature was added to the dataset. This was calculated by subtracting 00:00 pressure observations from the upcoming 12:00 pressure observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12-hour Snowfall Total**    \n",
    "As the SNOTEL data only includes snow depth data instead of snowfall data, snowfall was calculated based on changes in measured snowdepth. Due to the sensitivity of the SNOTEL snow depth measurement sensors, snow depth data from the SNOTEL site appeared noisy, often varying within an inch or two, even on days where no snowfall occurred.  For snowpack information, this noise can be considered minor as snowpack often increases to greater then 60 inches during a typical winter.   However, such noise does present challenges when determining snowfall amounts for smaller snowstorms (i.e. less then 3 inches) or hour by hour snowfall amounts. To minimize this potential for error, only 12 hour snowfall totals were estimated at 00:00 UTC and 12:00 UTC by calculating snow depth differences at those hours. Also only 12 hour snowfall events where greater then or equal to 3 inches occurred were considered a true snowfall event in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table showing the total number of snowfall events, along with mean, max, and standard deviation of snowfall for each year is found in **Table 3**.  A timeseries plot showing the snowdepth, along with these snowfall events is found in **Figure 2**.\n",

    "## Linear Regression Analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess snowfall prediction potential with a Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, a linear regression analysis was performed on each feature in the dataset.  For each potential meteorological feature data was plotted against snowfall totals which would occur over the next 12 hours.  Slope, standard error, R square values, along with p values were calculated for all variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "A table showing results from this analysis are shown in **Table 3**.  The features are sorted by largest absolute R value. Note that the features with highest absolute R values (>0.10) are KCCU Dewpoint, KCCU Cloud Cover, KXLV Dewpoint, KXLV Cloud Cover, KXLV 12-hour Pressure Change, and KCCU Wind Speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though Cloud Cover is included in this list, the p values are high and the amount of data missing is also very high. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features which are most likely to have predictive power in a linear model are those with both high R values and low p values.  The features which also have a significant p value (<0.05) in this analysis are KCCU Dewpoint, KXLV Dewpoint, and KXLV 12-hour Pressure Change. While the features do not have necessarily have R values which indicate strong linear relationships with snowfall, the low p value give confidence that the linear relationships which do exist are not just by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that that Cloud Cover is a categorical variable (values reported are in integers from 0 to 8) and wind direction is a circular variables (values range from 0 to 360 degrees).  Thus, these feature do not lend themselves well to a linear regression analysis where linearity is of primary importance. These features should utilized cautiously in linear regression models.\n",

    "## Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
    "Hourly data from three separate meteorological stations at or near the Copper Mountain Ski Resort were obtained, cleaned and evaluated. Snowfall events were also determined.   Using a linear regression analysis, the potential of meteorological features to predict the amount of snow likely to fall over a future 12 hour period was examined.  It was discovered that there are small relationships with future snowfall amounts, and it is statistically likely some of these relationships do not exist by chance. Dewpoint and 12-hour Pressure Changes are the features which were discovered to have statistically significant relationships to future snowfall.  Therefore, it is anticipated that there may be some 12 hour snowfall predictive ability a very simple Ordinary Least Squares model with only meteorological measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is recognition that snowfall is a very complex variable to forecast, and a simple OLS model may have limitations. Snowfall amounts can be dependent on a variety of factors including snow water equivalent, temperature during crystal formation in the upper atmosphere, along with melting/freezing activity as snowflakes fall to the surface.  Surface meteorological measurements will have limited knowledge of such complexities.  For this reason, it is recommended that upper air data (also freely available) be included in the model as it could be helpful in overcoming some of these complexities and limitations inherent in surface data.  While likely not feasible, obtaining daily snowfall measurements made by Copper Mountain in various locations of the mountain would likely be a very beneficial dataset to overcome some the SNOTEL measurement shortcomings.  Despite the complexities of a snowfall prediction, an OLS model is a good starting point to begin to understand how data science techniques could be utilized. \n",
